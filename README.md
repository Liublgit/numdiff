Project outline
Charles gikk raskt gjennom noen punkter som kan være greie å ha som utgangspunkt.

What am I solving?
i.e. find appropriate boundary conditions
Find out what the equation represents
Try and "classify" the PDE
Time dependent or not?
Is it hyperbolic/parabolic/elliptic? Is it a particular class, e.g. conservation law?
Most equations are
Hyperbolic conservation law (Lax-Wendroff?)
Possibly non-linear diffusion (Crank-Nicholson?)
Assorted elliptic problems (Discretizations in space with 5 point method?)
Given the rough behaviour, what method would you try?
What difficulties does the equation bring? (e.g. non-linearity makes implicit scheme more difficult)
Suggestions for different schemes above
Try and google for some methods
Implement!
Analysis aspect
Charles will cover what is expected on Friday
